# SQL Server Doctor MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for SQL Server tuning, diagnostics, and performance analysis. This server exposes SQL Server management capabilities to LLM applications.

### Example Usage

Ask your LLM client questions to troubleshoot and diagnose SQL Server issues:

**Configuration checks:**
- "Check my SQL Server configuration"
- "Is my SQL Server properly configured?"
- "Verify server settings"

**General troubleshooting:**
- "Users are complaining about slow queries, what's happening?"
- "Is something blocking my database?"

**Workload analysis:**
- "Analyze current SQL Server workload"
- "What queries are currently running?"
- "Which query is using the most CPU?"
- "Is there CPU pressure on the server?"
- "Show me any blocked sessions"

**Memory analysis:**
- "Does my SQL Server need more memory?"
- "Check memory pressure"
- "What's the Page Life Expectancy?"
- "Analyze SQL Server memory health"
- "Why is memory low?"

**Query performance tuning:**
- "Optimize this query" or "Tune this query"
- "Why is this query slow?"
- "How can I make this query faster?"
- "Find performance issues in this SELECT statement"
- "Analyze query execution plan"
- "Check if my query has antipatterns"
- "What indexes should I create for this query?"

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sqlserver-doctor-mcp.git
   cd sqlserver-doctor-mcp
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the package in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` with your SQL Server connection details:

   **For SQL Server Authentication:**
   ```env
   SQL_SERVER_HOST=your-server.database.windows.net
   SQL_SERVER_PORT=1433
   SQL_SERVER_DATABASE=master
   SQL_SERVER_USER=your_username
   SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD=your_password
   SQL_SERVER_DRIVER=ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
   ```

   **For Windows Authentication (local):**
   ```env
   SQL_SERVER_HOST=localhost
   SQL_SERVER_PORT=1433
   SQL_SERVER_DATABASE=master
   SQL_SERVER_USER=
   SQL_SERVER_PASSWORD=
   SQL_SERVER_DRIVER=ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server
   ```

## Usage with Claude Code

### Setup

1. In Claude Code, open MCP settings using the `/mcp edit` command

2. Add this configuration (replace `/path/to/` with your actual project path):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "sqlserver-doctor": {
         "command": "/path/to/sqlserver-doctor-mcp/venv/bin/python3",
         "args": ["-m", "sqlserver_doctor.main"],
         "cwd": "/path/to/sqlserver-doctor-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important Notes:**
   - Use the **full path** to your venv's Python (e.g., `/Users/yourname/sqlserver-doctor-mcp/venv/bin/python3`)
   - On Windows, use: `"C:\\path\\to\\sqlserver-doctor-mcp\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe"`
   - The server will automatically load settings from your `.env` file

3. Save the configuration and reload MCP servers in Claude Code

## Diagnostic Skills

This repository includes four diagnostic skills that provide intelligent workflows for using the MCP tools:

### 1. SQL Server Configuration Check (`sql-server-config-check`)

Verifies SQL Server configuration health by checking version and critical settings.

**Triggers on questions like:**
- "Check my SQL Server configuration"
- "Is my SQL Server properly configured?"
- "Verify server settings"

**What it does:**
1. Gets SQL Server version and edition
2. Analyzes max memory, MAXDOP, and cost threshold settings
3. Categorizes issues by severity (CRITICAL → WARNING → REVIEW → OK)
4. Provides prioritized, actionable recommendations

### 2. SQL Server Workload Analysis (`sql-server-workload-analysis`)

Analyzes current workload and resource pressure to identify performance bottlenecks.

**Triggers on questions like:**
- "Analyze SQL Server workload"
- "What's causing slow performance?"
- "Find blocking queries"
- "Is there CPU pressure?"

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes active sessions (blocking, long-running queries, resource consumption)
2. Checks CPU and I/O pressure via scheduler stats
3. Correlates findings (e.g., high CPU with specific sessions)
4. Explains wait types in plain language
5. Provides immediate actions, investigation steps, and preventive measures

### 3. SQL Server Memory Analysis (`sql-server-memory-analysis`)

Diagnoses SQL Server memory health and determines if more memory is needed.

**Triggers on questions like:**
- "Does my SQL Server need more memory?"
- "Check memory pressure"
- "What's the Page Life Expectancy?"
- "Analyze SQL Server memory health"

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes memory metrics (PLE, memory grants pending, pressure status)
2. Determines root cause (need more RAM vs need config changes)
3. Provides decision tree for diagnosing memory issues
4. Distinguishes between physical memory needs and configuration problems
5. Delivers clear recommendations with expected outcomes
6. Focuses on memory-specific tools to avoid unnecessary diagnostics

### 4. SQL Server Query Tuning (`sql-server-query-tuning`)

Systematically diagnoses and optimizes slow SQL Server queries through a phase-based approach that prioritizes query rewrites before index analysis.

**Triggers on questions like:**
- "Optimize this query" or "Tune this query"
- "Why is this query slow?"
- "How can I make this query faster?"
- "Analyze query performance"
- "Find performance issues in this query"
- "Check if my query has antipatterns"

**What it does:**
1. **Phase 1 - Baseline:** Executes query with statistics collection and captures actual execution plan
2. **Phase 2 - Antipatterns:** Detects non-SARGable predicates, SELECT *, correlated subqueries
3. **STOP GATE:** If HIGH/MEDIUM priority antipatterns found → fix query BEFORE creating indexes
4. **Phase 3 - Execution Plan:** Analyzes plan warnings, high-cost operators, cardinality mismatches
5. **Phase 4 - Statistics:** Checks statistics freshness if cardinality issues detected
6. **Phase 5 - Indexes:** Provides strategic index recommendations (lean indexes, key columns only)
7. **Phase 6 - Summary:** Comprehensive report with baseline vs expected improvement

**Key Features:**
- Query rewrites always come before index recommendations
- Detects and fixes non-SARGable predicates (e.g., `WHERE YEAR(col) = 2024`)
- Recommends lean indexes (key columns only) instead of wide covering indexes
- Evaluates columnstore suitability for analytical workloads
- Provides ready-to-execute SQL statements (CREATE INDEX, UPDATE STATISTICS)
- Estimates performance improvement magnitude

### Using the Skills

**Option 1: Project-Local (Recommended)**

The skills in `.claude/skills/` work automatically when you're working in this project directory. No additional setup needed!

**Option 2: Global Installation**

To use these skills across all projects, copy them to your global Claude skills directory:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
cp .claude/skills/*.md ~/.config/claude/skills/
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
Copy-Item .claude\skills\*.md "$env:APPDATA\Claude\skills\"
```

Once installed (either way), Claude will automatically use these skills when you ask matching questions!
